# 🦠 COVID-19 Forecasting & Trend Analysis Project

A data science project that explores global COVID-19 trends and forecasts using machine learning models.


## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes the COVID-19 pandemic using global time series data from Johns Hopkins University. It visualizes cases, identifies trends, and predicts future confirmed cases using machine learning models.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Johns Hopkins University CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
- Data includes global confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📅 Time series analysis (confirmed, deaths, recovered)
- 📍 Country-wise visualizations and comparisons
- 🤖 Forecasting using:
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - Bayesian Ridge Regression
- 📈 Evaluation using R² and MSE
- 📷 Visual insights through graphs & charts
-

## 📌 Conclusion

This project analyzed the global and country-wise trends of COVID-19 using time series data provided by Johns Hopkins University.

Key takeaways:
- Visualized cumulative and daily confirmed, death, and recovery cases.
- Compared countries using pie and bar charts.
- Built 3 machine learning models (Polynomial Regression, SVM, Bayesian Ridge) to predict future confirmed cases.
- Plotted 30-day forecasts and compared models using R² and MSE metrics.

This project showcases the use of:
- Time Series Data Processing
- Interactive Visualizations using Plotly & Matplotlib
- Supervised Regression Modeling in Scikit-learn


## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Include vaccination & population data
- Use LSTM or Prophet for advanced forecasting
- Add interactive dashboards for each country
